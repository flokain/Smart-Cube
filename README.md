# Smartcube

Smartcube aims to be the IOT Cube anyone can **a**fford, **b**uild and **c**onfigure.

Smartcube is a physical die, which houses electronics to detect when the die is tilted and which side is facing up. It then triggers events over the internet via its wifi connection.

At the moment smartcube can be configured to
- track the time you work on your projects (Toogl)
- trigger any generic webhooks

# Project Goals
The Smartcube Project started as an exercise and personal challenge to deliver a polished OpenSource IOT product for real world applications that can be used by anyone, not just tinkers.

To accomplish this vision I set the following goals:

| Goal                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Low cost                                | the costs for components and Material to build smartcube must be lower than 10â‚¬ in total on the regular market                                                                                                                       |

# Requirements
micropython 1.12 (not tested with 1.17)

2.4 ghz wifi network

# Setup

# Testing

Smart Cube is tested in 2 ways.

# Unit Tests On Device
The python code depends on platform dependent libraries.
Because of this unittests must be executed on a device.
unittests a run on the device. connect via REPL
and execute

```
import unittest
unittest.main("unittests")
```
TODO: #10 seperate unittests that are device independent

# functional testing
Tests against the webAPI are ran against an operational device.
at the moment one has to change the host variable in tests/api_test.py
and then run from the project root dir TODO: #11 parse host as variable to tests 
```
pytest
```

# Rest API Reference
restapi is openapi conform:
https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/flokain/smartcube/v1

## Feature requests

# Development
Developing for a microcontroller can be quite a challenge. The intention of this section is to provide a development environment that is as quickly as possible to setup and convenient as can be, requiring little to none knowledge of the microptython firmware building process for contributing.
If you choose to use your own environment feel free to use parts from mine and share ideas for making it better by filing an issue pr pull request.

## Setting up the development environment

The development environment looks like this:
Using VsCode you have code completion for micropython and thirdparty libraries which were initially configured with micropython-cli.
Via the pymakr vscode extension you can then upload and download files open a python interpreter on the device and other management stuff. unfortunately i had problems with the pymakr extension on several occasions, whe vs code was upgraded. please refer to [troubleshooting](#Troubelshooting the dev environment setup)

1. Prerequesites
   1. install vscode
   2. install docker
   3. install git
   
2. clone repo with sumbodules, because we need to build our own firmware from the micropython repository

    ```bash
    git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/flokain/Smart-Cube
    ```

3. cd into the repository and run micropy.
   > :warning: This **command results in an error**, but it works until the point where the stubs for intellisense are installed. TODO: #15 fix json parse error when running micropy

    ```bash
    cd Smart-Cube
    micropy
    ```

4. start vscode in the repos root folder

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

5. [activate recommended vscode extensions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35929746/automatically-install-extensions-in-vs-code). 
    TODO: #13 write how to activate all recommended extensions automatically
6. check at which path the device is mounted. `ls -la /dev/ttyUSB*` The default is /dev/ttyUSB0. If multiple are listed. try them out until one works ;)
    If your device is not connected at /dev/ttyUSB0 set the SMART_CUBE_PATH environment variable with the correct path and change the pymakr.conf file 

   ```bash
   export SMART_CUBE_PATH=/dev/ttyUSB1
   sed -i 's@"address": .*@"address": "'$SMART_CUBE_PATH'",@g' pymakr.conf
   ```
    now you can:
- [Build and deploy](#build-and-deploy) the firmware
- via pymakr (vscode command plalette or button in lower status bar) ![pymakr_bar](docs/images/pymakr_bar.png)
  -  connect to devices micropython cli REPL
  - upload files such as new scripts,
- use intellisense including device libraries like `machine` in the code base in `./src`

# Troubleshooting

## Cannot connect to device

Sometimes vscode upgrades break pymaker, and that was almost always the reason why the setup failed. for that reason find below the latest vscode and pymakr version that have been testet for this setup.

- vscode 1.61.2
- pymakr 1.1.16

## Build fails

seeing something like

```
Connecting...

A fatal error occurred: Failed to connect to ESP8266
make: *** [Makefile:198: deploy] Error 2
```

most certainly means you have an open connection to the device. Make sure that the pymakr console is disconnected: ![1613074125286](docs/images/disconnected.png)

## Functional Tests fail when executed together

Tthe reason might be that the wifi probing task gets blocked by many flash IOs and resets the connection: https://www.esp32.com/viewtopic.php?t=6800&p=29472

## Device is restarting in unpredictable ways

There are multiple reasons for that. follow the guidline to narrow it down and eventually fix it.

1. Check if the device is trying to connect to a 5ghz wifi. this is not supported by the ESP8266. Sometimes it runs in the hardcoded connection timeout of the chip, which is 10 seconds. sometimes it will get a connection but reset itself again. connect to a 2.4 ghz network to verify. if the problem persists go to step 2.

2. Check if the device has a reliable power source. some operations like connecting to the wifi drain so much power that in combination with crapy usb cables or power supplies the voltage drop may get
3. check if the device has enough free memory. the message `bcn_timout,ap_probe_send_start` before a restart indicates that the device is running out of memory.

# Build And Deploy Firmware

the following script uses docker to build the firmware, which includes the `smartcube` module in `./src` and all dependencies from `requirements.txt`. It then deploys the Firmware on the device. This is neccesary to save ram. frozen sourcecode (=firmware) is directly accessed and not loaded in to ram. 

> :warning: Be sure to **set SMART_CUBE_PATH from [Setup Development Environment Step 6](#setup-development-environment)** if your device is **not connected at /dev/ttyUSB0**
and **disconnect REPL** (pymakr > disconnect) from the device. Otherwise Deployment will fail

```
 ./build_deploy.sh 
```
if for some reason this command crashes, try to clean the whole build, whipe the device flash and restart form scratch via
```
 ./clean_build_deploy.sh
```

The Firmware build ommits the boot and main scripts and other files, which are all under `./src` but not in `./src`
## Deploy scripts and static files
To deploy those use the vscode command palette: `pymakr > Upload Project` or the Upload button from the lower status bar ![pymakr_bar](docs/images/pymakr_bar.png)

afterwards the cube will reboot and launch in operational mode.
you can now go on an
- [run functional tests](#functional-testing) against the cube
- configure
- use
